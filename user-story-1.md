## User Story #1 Astronomy Professor

As a college astronomy professor I want an app that identifies stars and constellations in real time and then documents the date and time that the constellation or star was located by a student.

For details regarding the app see the [README](https://github.com/deep-dive-coding-java-cohort-6/capstone-project-ideas-tnordquist/blob/master/README.md)
