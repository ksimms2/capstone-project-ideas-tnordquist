## User Story #3 Parent

As a parent I want an app that my child will want to use to get interested in getting outside and understanding something about the solar system and the stars and other things going on out there like satellites.  I would like the app to allow my child to take a snap shot of the part of the sky he was looking at, with the identity of the star or planet he was looking at and be able to send that shot and information to his friends.

For details regarding the app see the [README](https://github.com/deep-dive-coding-java-cohort-6/capstone-project-ideas-tnordquist/blob/master/README.md)
