## User Story 2 - Amateur Astronomer

As an astronomy hobbyist I want an app that allows me and my hobbyist friends to easily locate stars, constellations, galaxies, etc. that we want to look at so that we can more easily aim our telescopes.  I want to be able to connect with my hobbyist circle as well as find other hobbyists in the area and around the country using the same app.

For details regarding For details about the app see the [README](https://github.com/deep-dive-coding-java-cohort-6/capstone-project-ideas-tnordquist/blob/master/README.md)
