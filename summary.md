This will be an Android App. This app allows the user to point his phone at a celestial object or constellation in the night time sky, touch the screen at the location of the object, and that celestial app will be identified immediately in context of other celesial objects. The name, location, current knowledge of the object, etc. will be made available.  The presentation of the celestial sky will be aesthetically pleasing as possible. The app will require acquiring access to an api database containing the description and locations of those objects. Also, to make the app work, gps location capability tied to angle tilt of the phone will be required. The coordinate information needed for the app to locate and display a given celestial object will be constantly updated via the api. I believe a server will be needed for obtaining gps coordinates of the user. This app will allow users to log in and provide to other users useful information such as particularly good locations for observing the stars. Only those who log in to the service and have filled out a form will be able to communicate with others via the app: A third person user authentication service will be used for this part of the service.
